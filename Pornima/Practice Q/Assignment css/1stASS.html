     <!-- Poem -->
      <p>
      I met a TRaveller from an antique land,<br />
      Who said-"Two vast and trunkless legs of ston <br />
      stand in the desert.....Near them, on the sand,<br />
      Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose from,<br/>
      And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cpld command,<br />
      Tell that its sculptor well those passion read<br />
      which yet suevive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br />
      The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br />
      And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br />
      My name is Ozymandias, king of kings;<br />
      Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br />
      Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br />
      of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br />
      The lone and level sands stretch far away."<br />
